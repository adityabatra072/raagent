/**
 * Deterministic pre-routing for the agent prompt.
 *
 * READ THIS FIRST: keyword routing is NO LONGER the default. It exists for a
 * model loaded in a small context window, and nothing else.
 *
 * It was written when every model loaded at 2048 tokens (docs/SDK-FINDINGS.md
 * §5) and the full tool set cost 1261 of them. Under that pressure, showing
 * the model only the relevant groups was the difference between working and
 * stalling. But keyword matching decides what the model is ALLOWED to do from
 * the words the user happened to use, and it is wrong constantly once you
 * leave the demo script: "How much space have I got left on this phone?"
 * routed to `comms`, because "phone" is a comms trigger, so device_info was
 * never on the table. Measured on suites/general.yaml, 7 of 16 ordinary
 * requests never saw the tool they needed — a failure the model cannot
 * recover from, because you cannot call a tool you were not given.
 *
 * With the engine patched to honour the requested context window, the full
 * set fits, so composeRun exposes everything by default and the model gets to
 * decide. Narrow exposure stays available (`narrowExposure: true`) for a
 * small window, where a wrong guess still beats no room to think.
 *
 * Why this exists: on-device generation budgets are tight — the C++ layer
 * accounts generation against a ~2048-token window, so a system prompt
 * carrying all 16 tool schemas leaves a deliberation-heavy model almost no
 * room to think. On the iPhone rehearsal this showed up as "got no tools"
 * (thinking overrun) on exactly the beats that need deliberation. Exposing
 * only the relevant tool groups halves the prompt and restores the budget —
 * the same conditions the eval rig validates under.
 *
 * Routing is keyword-based and additive; unmatched prompts get the broad
 * default set. 'core' (memory + macros) is routed like everything else —
 * it used to ride along unconditionally, and those four extra schemas were
 * the difference between calendar-judgment passing 4/4 (rehearsal,
 * schedule-only) and stalling 0/3 in chat on the same phone.
